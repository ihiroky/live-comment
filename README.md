# live-comment

Show audiences' comments on your screen.

## How to setup

### Requirements

- node
- yarn
- Http server you like

### Server side

- Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihiroky/live-comment.git
cd live-comment
yarn install
yarn --cwd packages/comment build
yarn --cwd packages/server build
```

- Configure reverse proxy

e.g. Nginx
```
server {

  # ...

  location / {
    root /path/to/live-comment/packages/comment/build/;
    try_files $uri /index.html;
  }
  location /app {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:9080/;
  }
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;

  # ...

}
```

If you don't use reverse proxy, /path/to/live-comment/packages/comment/build must be served and expose 8080 port used by the server.

- Start websocket and api server

```bash
# Generate jwt keys, then move generated keys into a secure directory and write their path in server.config.json
./script/genjwtkey.sh

cd /path/to/live-comment/packages/server
vi server.config.json  # Add room name and password :(, and above jwt key path.
node dist/bundle/streaming/index.js -p 8080
node dist/bundle/api/index.js -p 9080
```

### Client

- Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihiroky/live-comment.git
```

- Build
```bash
cd live-comment
yarn install
cd packages/desktop
yarn build
yarn electron-builder -c electron-builder-config.json -l # Build install package for Linux
yarn electron-builder -c electron-builder-config.json -w # Build install package for Windows
yarn electron-builder -c electron-builder-config.json -m # Build install package for Mac
```

Then, install generated package in live-comment/packages/desktop/dist directory.

## How to use (client side)

Execute the executable file included in the install package generated by the client build.
